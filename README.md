SNHU CS255 System Analysis and Design


You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It also will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The following paragraph isn't part of the question prompts but it summerizes how I feel about systems/project design
I learned a lot about project organization during development of the driverpass system. Theres so many ways people need to organize and cooperate in order to conqour a big
scheduele. For work, I tried to implement a Gnatt diagram just to see how it worked. It was conforting to compartmentalize each aspect of my project. It felt much more achievable whith each component/part laid out. There were smaller deadlines with smaller stresses troughout rather than one giant anxiety the whole time. Only being releived when the project concluded. Basically everything I leaned in this course felt like this. Teaching how to break each project into smaller ones, and break down each responcibility of each person into more managable pieces of work. Anyway, onto the questions..

The DriverPass project was a new service by
