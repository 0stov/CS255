SNHU CS255 System Analysis and Design
#####################################################################################################################################################

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The DriverPass project was a new service by Liam. He saw a market opportunity. Too many people were failing driving exams and he saw the demand for a service that could teach 
people how to pass these exams. He wanted a system that put customers together with an instructor and vehicle. This is the system he wanted us to design. I like how my sequence diagrams turned out but they might be too involved. They sometimes included references to other use cases they didn't need to.
I think my use case diagram was weak. It included several important use cases but I think it failed to recognize all available use cases and tended to meld the interconnecting systems too much. 
I captured the users needs by first breaking down their needs into functional-nonfunctional requirements, then further breaking those into security, ui, platform, limitation, and adaptability requirements. This provided a nice checklist that I could compare the system to. If anything was lacking it was easier to see the area that needed work in this way. Understanding what the user wants/needs is important to deliver a product that meets those needs. Beyond that, it prevents developers from wasting their time designing and building something the user doesn't want. Its worth it ten times over to clearly define what the user wants, with clear example inputs and outputs; This can dramatically reduce waste.

I learned a lot about project organization during development of the driverpass system. Theres so many ways people need to organize and cooperate in order to conquer a big schedule. For work, I tried to implement a Gnatt diagram just to see how it worked in practice. It was comforting to compartmentalize each aspect of my project. It felt much more achievable with each component/part laid out. There were smaller deadlines with smaller stresses throughout rather than one giant anxiety the whole time. Only being relieved when the project concluded. Basically everything I learned in this course felt like this. Teaching how to break each project into smaller ones, and break down each responsibility of each person into more manageable pieces of work.
